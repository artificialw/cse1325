## Navigation
Every week during this class, we were given an assignment and there were three requirements that could be met, these included:
- Full Credit: The initial assignment.
- Bonus: Extra credit that can be completed for the assignment, increasing the difficulty of the assignment.
- Extreme Bonus: Extra credit that included topics that were never discussed during class, making this extremely difficult to achieve for all assignments.
- Both Bonus and Extreme Bonus would be add-ons to the Full Credit.
- Between P05-P07 and P10-P13 would be our fictional online computer store, ELSA.
